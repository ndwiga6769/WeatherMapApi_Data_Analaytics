# Kenyan Weather Forecast
This Python script fetches and visualizes a 5-day weather forecast for major cities in Kenya, including Nairobi, Mombasa, Kisumu, and Eldoret. It uses the OpenWeatherMap API to retrieve the forecast data and plots temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation for each city.

## Features
Multi-City Support: Get weather data for multiple Kenyan cities.
5-Day Forecast: Retrieves 3-hourly forecast data for the next five days.
Visualization: Plots temperature, humidity, wind speed, and precipitation using Matplotlib.
## Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: requests, pandas, matplotlib
## Getting Started
